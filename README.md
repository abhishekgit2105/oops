   COLLEGE MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

1.	WHAT DOES THE PROJECT ACTUALLY AIM AND HOW IT WORKS?
We have created a college management system in which we can store the data of professors and students and then also fetch them accordingly. It also allows user to remove a professor or a student.
•	Recruit a professor -> makes you add professor details.
•	Search for a professor -> displays the professor information.
•	Remove a professor-> makes you remove data of professor.
•	Admit a student-> makes you add student details.
•	Search for a student-> displays the student info.
•	Remove a student->make you remove data of a student
•	Exit->ends the program.
The names suggest what the functions would do. However, “Search for a professor” further takes the user to another menu.
“Professor information block” which includes the following options->
•	Fetch the details of all the professors.
•	Fetch the details of the professors by name.
•	Fetch the details of the professors by role.
•	Fetch the details of the professors by subject.
•	Fetch the details of the professors by college.
•	Return to main menu.
So, this menu allows us to search for Professors by various ways.
Similarly, “Student information block” which includes the following options->
•	Fetch the details of all the students.
•	Fetch the details of all the students of a particular batch.
•	Fetch the details of all the students of a particular batch.
•	Fetch the details of all the students of a particular college.
•	Return to main menu.

2.	WHAT WE USED-> 
•	SWITCH CASE: -Switch case statement is used when we have multiple conditions and we need to perform different actions based on the condition.

•	 FUNCTIONS LIKE: - fflush(stdin) used to empty the buffer.

•	 LOOPS: - 
     a)while loop
     b)for loop
     c)range-based for loop: -It is    a new feature of C++ which
     was added in C++11. Also range based for loop will only
     work in code editors like “Code Blocks” and “Visual Studio”.

•	 IF ELSE STATEMENTS: -It is used to execute some statement code block if the       expression is evaluated to true, otherwise executes “else” statement code block.

•	Classes and Objects: - A class in C++ is a user defined data type or data structure. In simple words, a class is a collection of objects of similar type. It is an instance of a class. When a class is defined, no memory is allocated but when object is instantiated memory is allocated.

•	Getline() method: -It is used so that while taking input, space is also taken as input.

•	ENCAPSULATION: - Binding data members and member     functions in one unit known as a class. With the help of this concept, data is not accessible to the outside world and    only those functions which are declared in the class, can access it.

•	  INHERITANCE: -Inheritance is a process by which objects of new class    acquire the properties of objects of existing class. Using Inheritance,   we can increase a class’s functionalities.

•	DATA HIDING: -Using access specifiers like public, private and protected we can choose which members can be accessed by outside sources and which members cannot.

•	STL: - We used classes defined in Standard Template Library like "string" and "vector" classes.

•	POINTERS: -We used “this” pointer to get and set the values of data members. Whenever a member function
